Idea: Make this a proper linux CLI app

[ ] : Need proper exit codes
[ ] : A menu
[ ] : Reorganize source files
[ ] : A configuration file that shows where the decks are, where the history file is
[ ] : A history file that stores information for doing spaced repetition
[ ] : Spaced repetition functionality
[ ] : Bainbridge integration??

## A menu

$
  1. Study deck
  2. List decks
  3. Edit decks
  4. Load deck from text file
  5. Delete deck
  6. Show configuration file location
  0. Exit

  1.
    1. Study the deck
    2. Study the deck and record confidence scores
    0. exit

  2 just lists the decks in the deck directory pointed to by the config file

  3 idk how to do this, maybe open the text editor and have a way to delete cards?

  4 Ask for path to deck to load, return file permission or does-not-exist errors, parse deck, point out errors if deck parsing unsuccessful

  5.
    1. Select deck to delete
    0. Exit
      
      1 shows the decks, allows a selection to be made, prompts 'Are you sure you want to delete the deck called {deck name}?'
      Deletes 
  
  6 prints the absolute path to the configuration files

Should have the source deck text file
First time loading from text file, it should create a new deck file with more fields:
  Deck id, deck name, then cards with card id, card front, card back
A deck history file with information about when-studied, what confidence score at what time-of-review.

Deck name should not have newline character in it
Card propmt should allow you to exit at any time
